Hi, Iâ€™m Kethnulee Weerasinghe, a passionate and driven software engineer with a graduation on the horizon this year. While I excel in programming with proficiency in PHP, C#, and ASP.NET, my true strength lies in business analysis. I specialize in creating detailed diagrams to help clients visualize and build their software solutions.
