## About
Hi, Iâ€™m Kethnulee Weerasinghe, a passionate and driven software engineer with a graduation on the horizon this year. While I excel in programming with proficiency in PHP, C#, and ASP.NET, my true strength lies in business analysis. I specialize in creating detailed diagrams to help clients visualize and build their software solutions.With strong skills in creative management, problem-solving, and web design, I continuously strive to enhance my expertise and evolve into a highly talented software engineer and business analyst. I approach every project with a blend of creativity, attention to detail, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. Beyond coding and analysis, I'm an avid enthusiast of discovering various musical languages and listening to diverse melodies. This passion fuels my creativity and inspiration, allowing me to bring fresh perspectives to my work.
